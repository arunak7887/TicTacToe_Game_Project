Logic and Explanation:

The code you provided is for a basic Tic Tac Toe game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It sets up the game board, handles player moves, checks for a winner or a draw, and allows players to reset the game. It uses event listeners to respond to player clicks on the game board and buttons.


The provided JavaScript code implements a Tic Tac Toe game. Here's a breakdown:
step1:
Initialization: The code initializes variables to track player turns (turnO), moves (count), and selects various elements from the HTML document.


step2:
Winning Patterns: It defines an array winPatterns containing all possible winning combinations on a Tic Tac Toe board.


Step3:
Game Logic:
It adds event listeners to each box (cell) of the game board. When a box is clicked, it updates the box with "X" or "O" based on the current player's turn, disables the box, increments the move count, and checks for a winner or a draw.
The checkWinner() function iterates through winPatterns to check if any player has won based on the current state of the board. If there's a winner, it displays a message.
If there's no winner after 9 moves, it declares the game as a draw.


Step4:
Button Actions:
The "New Game" button and "Reset" button have event listeners attached. Clicking these buttons resets the game to its initial state.


Step5:
Utility Functions:
resetGame(): Resets the game variables and enables the boxes for a new game.
gameDraw(): Handles the case when the game ends in a draw.
disableBoxes(): Disables all boxes on the game board.
enableBoxes(): Enables all boxes on the game board.
Overall, the code creates a functional Tic Tac Toe game where players take turns clicking on the game board, and the game tracks the progress, announces winners, and handles draws.
